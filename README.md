# C++ Makefile
C++ Makefile that can be reused in other projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a makefile and some simple C++ code. The purpose is to demonstrate the usage of a simple C++ makefile that can be dropped into other projects with minimal changes. Some examples of the functionality include:
- Parallel builds
- Clang formatting and linting
- Separate debug and release builds
- Separate folders for building on different operating systems and architectures
- Command line options such as verbosity
- Support for cpp and h files in subfolders
